on The Discovery Chael,

182
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:17,001
where all your intestines

183
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,970
sort of just slip
right out of your butt.

184
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:21,438
Thank you.
I know what Ebola is.
Uh-huh.

185
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:24,141
Now, tell me.
What would a West-African virus

186
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:25,709
be doing in our lab?

187
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,211
Hmm?

188
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:30,080
So you're chasing around
a fly,

189
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:34,085
and in your world
I'm the idiot.

190
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,789
Jesse, listen.

191
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:40,425
This fly-- any fly--

192
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,992
cannot be in our lab.

193
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,459
It's-- It's a problem.

194
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:44,925
It's a contamination,

195
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,259
and that is in no way
a misuse of the word.

196
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,393
Okay?

197
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,030
So in terms of keeping
our cook cle

198
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,298
and our product unadulterated,

199
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,867
we need to take this very seriously.

200
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,401
Now do you understand?

201
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,638
So is that your fly saber?

202
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:07,845
This is a swatter.

203
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,114
It happens to work quite well,
thank you.

204
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,118
Uh-huh. Hey,
what happened to your head?

205
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,920
Nothing. I'm fine.

206
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:18,855
You didn't hit it,
like really-- really hard?

207
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,023
My head is not the problem,
Jesse.

208
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:23,259
The fly is the problem.

209
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:28,264
You didn't happen to maybe...

210
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:31,367
try our product, did you?

211
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:35,901
Jess I know this seems
unusual to you, a layman.

212
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:38,704
A fly-- I get it--
seems insignificant, right?

213
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:40,038
But trust me.

214
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,507
In a highly controlled
environment such as this--

215
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:46,211
[fly buzzes]

216
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,046
...any pollutant--

217
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,015
[buzzing]

218
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,716
...no matter how small--

219
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,321
...could completely--

220
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,934
Hello.

221
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:16,771
What?

222
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:23,276
Were you here all night?

223
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,045
Have you even slept?

224
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,081
No. Jesse, look.
I'm fine. Okay

225
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,181
Will you just please focus--

226
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:32,385
[beeping]

227
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:38,157
Okay, look.
We're running late,
so let's just get started.

228
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:40,693
Shall we?
The sooner we do it,
the sooner we're done.

229
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,796
Fricn' finally.

230
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,531
[grunts]

231
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,401
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

232
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:50,169
What are you doing?

233
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:52,471
It's time to alkaline.

234
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:55,440
Have you not heard
a word I said?

235
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:58,844
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

236
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,580
Have I been speaking to self?

237
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:04,049
The timer went off, yo.

238
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,885
How long is this batch
going to be good for?
An hour? Two?

239
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,187
The batch will be good
for nothing

240
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:11,356
if we don't clear
the contaminant.

241
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:13,325
Clear the contaminant?

242
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,159
We're making meth here,

243
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:16,594
not space shuttles.

244
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:19,863
We're making nothing
until we catch this fly.

245
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:21,131
What fly?

246
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:24,335
Where the hell is this fly?

247
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,835
Not like I've even seen
the thing.

248
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:28,637
Maybe your positive pressure
blew it out the door or something.

249
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:32,208
No, no. It is here.
It is around. Okay?

250
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,744
He's around,
and i am not going to expose

251
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:38,048
this batch to the open air
and contamination.

252
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:41,584
Now, you can leave me
to deal with this myself,
or you can help me,

253
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:42,751
but you are right.

254
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:44,219
We are running out of time,

255
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,051
so I need your answer
right now.

256
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,092
Okay.

257
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:08,936
Hey, tick-tock. Yo.

258
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:19,579
Look, I like making
cherry products,
but let's keep it real.

259
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:21,847
All right, we make poison

260
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:24,082
for people who don't care.

261
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:26,984
We probably have
the most un-picky customers
in the world.

262
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:29,619
No, no, no, no, no.
No rationalizing.

263
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,121
We'll find it any minute now.
Don't give up.

264
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,669
Did you--

265
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:50,707
Did you know that there's
an acceptable level of rat turds

266
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:54,610
that can go into candy bars?

267
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:57,613
That's the government, Jack.

268
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:00,049
Even the government

269
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:03,186
doesn't care that much
about quality.

270
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:10,626
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs? Huh?

271
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:14,130
Pig lips and assholes,

272
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:17,566
but I say, hey,
have at it, bitches,

273
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:21,070
because I love hotdogs,

274
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:23,773
and, you know,
see what I'm--

275
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,040
What are you doing?

276
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:27,009
Oh. Hey.

277
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,748
Look, let me just top it off,

278
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:33,450
all right, really quick.

279
00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:35,786
A little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid,

280
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,386
No harm done.
Then we're golden.

281
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,660
It stays closed.
That's an order.

282
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,028
You can't order shit,
Adolf.

283
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:51,733
We're 50-50 partners.
Remember?

284
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,506
Ow!

285
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,243
God, what is your problem,
bro?

286
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,812
Freakin' psycho.

287
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,114
[groans]

288
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:07,547
Jesse.

289
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,349
Oh, God, it, like, hit bone.

290
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,716
Jesse.

291
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,485
Jesse.

292
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,289
You see it, right?

293
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,158
You see it?

294
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,460
Yeah.

295
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:27,164
Get it.

296
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,534
You want me to get it?

297
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,303
Yes.

298
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:38,674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow.

299
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,743
Move slowly.

300
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:41,944
I know.

301
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,945
I'm moving slowly, yeah.

302
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,148
Absolutely.
I'm just going to need
your swatter thing.

303
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,420
Yeah. Come on.

304
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:56,156
Oh, yeah.
It's okay, come on.

305
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:00,659
Come on.
Make it count.

306
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,860
Yeah, no, no,
I'm gonna--

307
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:04,629
I'm going to make it count,
all right.

308
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:07,132
Ok. Now.

309
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,666
On three.

310
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,267
Okay.

311
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:11,569
One--

312
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:13,337
Ow!

313
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:16,438
Yeah. You like that?

314
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:17,839
Hurts, huh?

315
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,207
[groaning]

316
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,643
Did you get it?

317
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:25,412
I think so, yeah.
Where is it?

318
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:27,447
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

319
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,448
Who cares?
I got it.

320
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:31,116
Oh, Jesus, seriously?

321
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:33,552
Where is it?

322
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:37,122
It's, uh, right there.
Look.

323
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:40,559
Look. See?
I told you I got it.

324
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:51,772
This is a raisin.

325
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:55,476
Look, I definitely got it,
man.

326
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,078
All right--
[fly buzzing]

327
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,015
Oh, man.

328
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,350
He's got some skills, yo.

329
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:05,419
I'll give him that.

330
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:09,491
Look...

331
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:13,896
I feel like I'm running out of ways
to explain this to you,

332
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,533
but once more I shall try.

333
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:21,538
This fly is a major problem
for us.

334
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,208
It will ruin our batch.

335
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,244
Now, we need to destroy it

336
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:30,382
and every trace of it
so we can cook.

337
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,250
Failing that...

338
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,721
we're dead.

339
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,795
There is no more room
for error.

340
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:46,499
Not with these people.

341
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:52,338
All right,
how about we go get some air?

342
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,275
Get some air?

343
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,179
Your answer to
"We're sliding head-first
into a massive crap--"

344
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,881
Mister-- Mr. White,

345
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,219
I understand that
the fly is a serious thing.

346
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,721
Now, all right?
I'm on board.

347
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:09,091
I'm just saying maybe
if we went and got some air,

348
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,059
it would help us
come up with a plan

349
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:12,624
on how to catch it.

350
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:14,257
Then come back down here

351
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,457
and subtract his ass.

352
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,994
[mutters]

353
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:35,029
[air hisses]

354
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,434
Oh, wait,
do you have your keys?

355
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:41,003
Yeah.
You're sure?

356
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:42,938
Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

357
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,240
Yeah.

358
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:46,675
Hey!

359
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,944
If you're not going to help me,
stay out of my way!

360
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:51,313
Hey!
[door rattles]

361
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,420
Yo. Yo, does somebody have
an ax I can use?

362
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:00,954
El ax-o!

363
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,656
<i>Peligroso!</i> El ax-o!

364
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,476
[buzzes]

365
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,412
There we go.

366
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,784
Say good night.

367
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:45,120
[objects clattering]

368
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:46,687
Son of a bitch!

369
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:53,426
Son of a...

370
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:56,996
Shit! Damn it!

371
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:01,967
Where in the hell is that...

372
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,817
What the hell?

373
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,719
[tapping on window]

374
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:27,757
Need some juice maybe?

375
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,520
Knock yourself out.

376
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:36,003
It's a real one.
Yeah, like yours was working.

377
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:37,971
No, no...

378
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:41,807
No, no-- Look, we're trying
to decontaminate.

379
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:44,709
You don't decontaminate
by contaminating further.

380
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,177
What the hell is all this?

381
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,415
Here, how about this?

382
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,317
"Nontoxic glue strips."

383
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:56,352
Yeah, baby,
it's got pheromones.

384
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:58,520
I got a buttload.
We hang them up all over the place.

385
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:00,388
It won't be able to resist.

386
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:08,329
I sure hope we have enough.

387
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:12,032
[Jesse]
I'm going to go
out on a limb and say yeah.

388
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,202
[Walt]
Do you see him?

389
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:20,008
How long do you think
you've been awake?

390
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,043
Why do you keep
asking me that?

391
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:24,879
Just figure you could use
some coffee, is all.

392
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:26,848
I know I could.

393
00:25:26,882 --> 00:25:28,949
How about it?

394
00:25:30,518 --> 00:25:31,985
Yeah.

395
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:36,123
You take cream and sugar?

396
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:37,324
Black is fine.

397
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:53,006
Why don't you
just leave him be?

398
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,409
Let the traps do the work.

399
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:58,680
These pheromones
are supposed to kick ass.

400
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:04,585
I bet we catch this mo-fo
any second.

401
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:20,299
Thank you.

402
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:24,169
You ever have, like,
a wild animal

403
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:25,904
trapped our house?

404
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,878
Not that I can recall, no.

405
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:36,215
We did, this one time,

406
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:38,083
back when it was
my aunt's house,

407
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:42,388
back before she died
of cancer.

408
00:26:42,422 --> 00:26:47,191
Possum.
Big, freaky-looking bitch.

409
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:51,228
Hey, since when did they
change it to "opossum"?
What's up with that?

410
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:52,597
I mean, when I was coming up,

411
00:26:52,631 --> 00:26:54,599
it was just "possum."

412
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:58,472
"Opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

413
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:01,742
Why they gotta go changing
everything?

414
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:04,644
Whatever. They're just
big rats anyways,

415
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:06,145
giant pink-tailed rats

416
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,680
with their pink rat faces,

417
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:10,549
totally freaky,

418
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,851
like alien rats.

419
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:18,791
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped,

420
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:23,162
but he was living there
under the house.

421
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:26,532
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room,

422
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:29,768
always scurrying around.

423
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:31,937
Sometimes I'd see him
outside at night,

424
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:35,207
and he would just,
you know, freeze.

425
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:38,744
And it's like you're not looking
right at it. Right?

426
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:41,713
I mean, it thinks
it's fooling you.

427
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:45,450
That's what they do.
They play dead or whatever.

428
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:47,786
It's just so lame.

429
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,257
Is there a discernible point
to this story,

430
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:56,126
a point that
you'll be arriving at

431
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:59,429
sometime in the near future?

432
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:03,367
It was just a total bitch
to get out. It took forever.

433
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:07,971
A guy came,
set all these traps and all,

434
00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:10,140
and he finally got it,

435
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:12,008
but my aunt,

436
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:15,678
she didn't believe it.

437
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:20,016
She kept insisting she
could still hear the thing.

438
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,219
I mean, you could not
tell her any different.

439
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,221
She started keeping
an old umbrella

440
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,656
by her chair.

441
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:30,726
Man, she would just bang
on the floor and yell at it,

442
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,462
even gave it a name.

443
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:35,564
It was, uh, Sc--

444
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:37,466
Scrabble.

445
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,867
Yeah, that was it.

446
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:41,703
"Scrabble, just knock it off."
Bang, bang, bang.

447
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:48,343
She got like that
toward the end.

448
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,914
Got obsessive about stuff,

449
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:56,952
just got mad about stuff.

450
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,854
We didn't know what was up.

451
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:03,458
It wasn't like her
to be that way.

452
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:09,864
But it turned out
that the--

453
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:13,268
the cancer had spread
to her brain,

454
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:16,304
and that was why.

455
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,140
It metastasized.

456
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:26,114
But it was good that
that was when we decided
to take her to the doctor

457
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:31,152
because then we knew
what was up

458
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,022
and got her some treatment

459
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:36,658
and meds so she wasn't
stressing all the time.

460
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:45,199
It was a lot better
after that.

461
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,902
She was a lot happier.

462
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:56,277
[groans]

463
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,778
Where the hell is he?

464
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,892
I've been to my oncologist,
Jesse, just last week.

465
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:17,064
I'm still in remission.

466
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,400
I'm healthy.

467
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:24,471
Okay, so good.
Great.

468
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,844
Well, no end
in sight.

469
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,880
That's great.

470
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,821
Well, I missed it.

471
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:51,397
There was some perfect moment,

472
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,399
and it passed me right by.

473
00:30:55,969 --> 00:31:00,673
Yeah, I had to have enough
to leave them.

474
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:03,743
That was the whole point.

475
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,981
None of this makes any sense

476
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:10,484
if I didn't have enough.

477
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:17,391
But it had to be before
she found out... Skyler.

478
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:19,693
It had to be before that.

479
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:23,063
Perfect moment...

480
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,966
for what?

481
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,968
To drop dead?

482
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,738
What, are you saying
you want to die?

483
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:38,012
I'm saying I've lived too long.

484
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,919
You want them
to actually miss you.

485
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:47,355
You know?

486
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:49,791
You want their memories of you

487
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,660
to be--

488
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:57,934
But she just won't understand.

489
00:31:57,968 --> 00:31:59,936
She just--

490
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:04,876
No matter how well
I explain it,

491
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:08,013
these days
she just has this--

492
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:11,717
this--

493
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:13,019
I mean, I truly believe

494
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:16,223
there exists
some combination of words.

495
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:18,425
There must exist

496
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,593
certain words

497
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:22,831
in a certain, specific order

498
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:24,633
that would explain all of this,

499
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:28,471
but with her I just--

500
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:31,575
I just can't ever seem
to find them.

501
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,044
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

502
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,048
I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state,

503
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,217
but before the fugue state

504
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:40,585
they didn't have enough money,

505
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:43,054
so no, not then.

506
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:56,935
And plus my daughter
wasn't born yet.

507
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:59,771
It had to be
after Holly was born.

508
00:32:59,805 --> 00:33:01,439
Mr. White--

509
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:03,641
Definitely
before the surgery.

510
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,880
Oh, Christ.

511
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:10,982
That damn second cell one.

512
00:33:11,016 --> 00:33:12,884
How could I possibly...

513
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:15,920
[groans]

514
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:25,830
Ah, I know the moment.

515
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:33,271
It was the night Jane died.

516
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:49,317
and we needed diapers,
and so I said I'd go,

517
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:52,116
but it was just an excuse.

518
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:53,917
Actually, that was
the night I--

519
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,749
I brought you your money,
remember?

520
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,316
Yeah, I remember.

521
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,649
But afterward I stopped
at a bar.

522
00:34:04,684 --> 00:34:09,648
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

523
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:12,416
I just walked in, sat down.

524
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,122
I never told you.

525
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:22,057
That you went to a bar?

526
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:32,466
I sit down, and this man,
this stranger,

527
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,301
he engages me in conversation.

528
00:34:35,336 --> 00:34:36,970
Now, he's a complete stranger.

529
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:43,242
But he turns out
to be Jane's father,

530
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:46,412
Donald Margolis.

531
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:48,047
What are you talking about?

532
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:50,884
Of course I didn't know it
at the time.

533
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:54,020
I mean, it was just some guy
in a bar.

534
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:56,990
didn't put it together
until after the crash

535
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:58,258
when he was all over the news.

536
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,928
Jane's dad.

537
00:35:00,962 --> 00:35:04,298
I mean, think of the odds.

538
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,900
Once I tried
to calculate them,

539
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:08,169
but they're astronomical.

540
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:10,772
I mean, think of the odds

541
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:12,705
of me going in, sitting down

542
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,102
that night in that bar

543
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:16,637
next to that man.

544
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:21,740
What did you talk about?

545
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:29,212
Oh, water on Mars.

546
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,316
Family.

547
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:38,486
What about family?

548
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:44,023
I told him
that I had a daughter,

549
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,926
and he told me
he had one, too.

550
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:52,329
Then he said,
"Never give up on family."

551
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:56,999
And I didn't.

552
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:01,336
I-- I took his advice.

553
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,642
[mutters]

554
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,210
The universe is random.

555
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:20,144
It's not inevitable.

556
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,180
It's simple chaos.

557
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:28,250
It's subatomic particles
in endless, aimless collision.

558
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:30,686
That's what science teaches us,

559
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,421
but what is this saying?

560
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:36,991
What is it telling us,

561
00:36:37,025 --> 00:36:38,258
when on the very night

562
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:42,896
that this man's daughter dies,

563
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,600
it's me who's having
a drink with him?

564
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:52,138
How can that be random?

565
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:54,073
Hey, listen, Mr. White.
Hey--

566
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:56,076
Hey, sit down.

567
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,544
No-- No.

568
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:01,149
No, it's--

569
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:04,220
Oh.

570
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:06,021
Oh.

571
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:13,029
No, that--
that was the moment.

572
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,833
That night.

573
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,307
I should never have left home.

574
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:27,647
Never gone to your house.

575
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,887
Maybe things would have--

576
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,362
Oh, thought I was--

577
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:49,406
I was at home watching TV.

578
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:53,949
Some--

579
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:57,991
Some nature program
about elephants.

580
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:03,236
Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

581
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,947
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

582
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:14,954
She was singing a lullaby.

583
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:22,528
Ah--

584
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:29,602
If had just lived
right up to that moment

585
00:38:29,636 --> 00:38:31,637
and not one second more--

586
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:36,142
[fly buzzing]

587
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:47,452
that would've been perfect.

588
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,429
[fly buzzing]

589
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,008
He's not coming down.

590
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:06,568
Must be Thailand-hot
up there.

591
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:09,904
That's why he likes it.

592
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:14,009
Thailand's hot, right?

593
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:15,277
Yeah.

594
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,883
See? That's why.

595
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:20,321
Oh, Jesus.

596
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:21,757
Hey, wait.

597
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,794
Here.

598
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,864
[casters rolling]

599
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:30,639
[sighs]

600
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:40,175
He's not coming down.

601
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,385
He's staying up there
forever.

602
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,999
[footsteps]

603
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:12,080
What are you--
What are you doing?

604
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:15,080
What do you think?
I'm going to get that bitch.

605
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,649
Uh...

606
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,985
No, you're going to break
your neck.

607
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,986
Yeah, yeah. Just--

608
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:29,990
No, seriously, you're--
This is a bad idea.

609
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:32,659
[grunting]
Damn it.

610
00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:35,395
Jesse.

611
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:36,729
Just hold onto it.

612
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:38,864
Hold it still?

613
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:54,711
Jesse.

614
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:01,016
I'm sorry.

615
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,751
Sorry for what?

616
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:03,919
Being a lunatic?

617
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,958
I'm sorry about Jane.

618
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,736
Yeah. Me, too.

619
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,775
No, I mean, uh--

620
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:31,581
I'm very sorry.

621
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,388
It's not your fault.

622
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:43,659
But it's not mine either.

623
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:45,794
It's no one's fault,

624
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,729
not even hers.

625
00:41:54,365 --> 00:41:56,128
Sucker's just sitting there.

626
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:03,134
We are who we are, Mr. White.

627
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,803
You know, just two junkies

628
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:08,906
with a duffel bag full of cash.

629
00:42:08,941 --> 00:42:10,542
Like you said,

630
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:12,511
we both would've been dead
within a week.

631
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,013
But I miss her, though.

632
00:42:20,552 --> 00:42:22,152
God, I do.

633
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:27,222
[grunting]

634
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:29,591
[gasps]

635
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,328
Jesse, come down.

636
00:42:34,362 --> 00:42:37,664
Wait, I am so close.

637
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,133
Let it go.

638
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:44,668
We need to cook.

639
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,537
What about the contamination?

640
00:42:49,406 --> 00:42:51,107
It's all contaminated.

641
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:55,544
[sighs]

642
00:42:57,381 --> 00:43:00,150
[mutters]

643
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:01,818
I definitely scared him.

644
00:43:04,422 --> 00:43:06,456
Probably stay out of our way--
[buzzing]

645
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:12,728
[mutters]
God.

646
00:43:37,425 --> 00:43:38,660
Yeah!

647
00:43:38,695 --> 00:43:42,297
Zap! Somebody got got, yo!

648
00:43:42,332 --> 00:43:43,365
You see that, Mister--

649
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:46,234
[Walt snoring]

650
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:15,163
[metal rattling]

651
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,243
[sighs]

652
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,116
Bins are packed?

653
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,184
Bins are packed.

654
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,488
How's the yield?

655
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:41,791
Two-oh-two and change.

656
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:43,459
You okay getting home?

657
00:44:43,493 --> 00:44:45,895
Yeah. Better.

658
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:47,063
Thanks.

659
00:44:47,097 --> 00:44:48,764
<i>Mañana,</i> then.

660
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:58,975
[engine starts]

661
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,648
Jesse, come here.

662
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:11,919
I couldn't chance
saying it inside.

663
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:15,155
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

664
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:22,261
That half a pound
that I said we're off by--

665
00:45:22,295 --> 00:45:25,697
Now, I'm not accusing you,
but if...

666
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:27,899
You understand?

667
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,001
And if they
ever found out--

668
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:36,040
I didn't take shit.

669
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,582
I'm just saying that I won't be able
to protect you.

670
00:45:45,685 --> 00:45:48,253
Who's asking you to?

671
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,015
[snoring]

672
00:46:15,861 --> 00:46:17,628
[fly buzzing]

673
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:20,931

674
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:23,233
